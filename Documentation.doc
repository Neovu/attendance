Creating a new database


Before Install you have to get ready your database first. Firstly, You have to create a new database before installing – Attendance System in your mysql server. If you already know how to do this/or have already created one just skip to the next step. Your host will most likely be running phpMyAdmin as mysql manager, if that's the case here's a step by step guide (if not the proccess will be very similar on other managers). Login to your control panel, find and click phpMyAdmin link: Click on the database tab in the top menu, enter any name you like and click create




Uploading Files


After creating a database, unzpip the .zip file. No upload the contents of Attendance System folder to your servers root folder (usually called www or html or something similar) or a sub-directory, shared hosting providers usually have a web based file manager, but you should use something like Filezilla to do the upload as the web based managers can cause various problems fairly often. Make sure that application/storage and all the sub-folders are writable by your server (have 777 permissions if you are on shared hosting). You can change files and folders permissions by right-clicking them in the filemanager, clicking file permissions, and then entering 777 in the permissions field.
