Creating a new database

Before Install you have to get ready your database first. Firstly, You have to create a new database before installing Attendance system in your mysql server. If you already know how to do this/or have already created one just skip to the next step. Your host will most likely be running phpMyAdmin as mysql manager, if that's the case here's a step by step guide (if not the proccess will be very similar on other managers). Login to your control panel, find and click phpMyAdmin link: Click on the database tab in the top menu, enter any name you like and click create.
